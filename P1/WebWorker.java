/**
* Web worker: an object of this class executes in its own new thread
* to receive and respond to a single HTTP request. After the constructor
* the object executes on its "run" method, and leaves when it is done.
*
* One WebWorker object is only responsible for one client connection. 
* This code uses Java threads to parallelize the handling of clients:
* each WebWorker runs in its own thread. This means that you can essentially
* just think about what is happening on one client at a time, ignoring 
* the fact that the entirety of the webserver execution might be handling
* other clients, too. 
*
* This WebWorker class (i.e., an object of this class) is where all the
* client interaction is done. The "run()" method is the beginning -- think
* of it as the "main()" for a client interaction. It does three things in
* a row, invoking three methods in this class: it reads the incoming HTTP
* request; it writes out an HTTP header to begin its response, and then it
* writes out some HTML content for the response content. HTTP requests and
* responses are just lines of text (in a very particular format).
